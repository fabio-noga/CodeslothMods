### Fast Recall to the surface!

When the magic mirror is on the hand of the player, right click it to teleport to your spawnpoint. If your bed is destroyed you will be teleported to the last place that your bed was!

## How to get the magic mirror:
You can get the magic mirror from a level 5 Cleric Villager (The one with the brewing stand)


## Some Questions

> *Is there a recipe for the mirror?*

No, the mirror can only be purchased to increase the rarity of this item. Only the cleric villager can use magic properties, not the player.

> *Does the mirror break?*

Nope, the mirror has infinite uses!

> *Can the mirror be spammed?*

No, the mirror has a tiny cooldown.
