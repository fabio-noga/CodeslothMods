Gather crops with themselves or with a hoe, without needing to replant each seed!

CurseForge Page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/improved-farming

## How to use
When you have a fully grown crop, `Right Click` with one of the items that it drops or a hoe or bone meal to gather it! For example, if you're trying to get wheat, you `Right Click` on the wheat block with a wheat item/wheat seeds/any hoe/bone meal in the mainhand! Simple as that.

__It works with any crop, nether wart and cocoa beans!__

_With this mod you can spam bone meal forever!_

## Some Questions

> *Can I use bone meal in Nether warts?*

You can use bone meal on nether warts to gather it (it will not consume the nether wart) but you still can't use bone meal on nether warts, just like in vanilla.

> *What happens to the seed that I have in hand when cropping?*

When you gather a crop it will drop the normal items that you would get from punching it, minus 1 seed, so it is used in the re-planting.

> *Can I use a hoe with cocoa beans?*

Yes, don't get your hand dirty!

> *Can I use this in servers?*

Yes! This works normally in servers too!
